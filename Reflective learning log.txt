Key questions you should try to answer in your learning log are as follows.

What did I learn about the mathematical algorithms? I.e., solving boundary value problems, numerical ill-conditioning, etc.

What did I learn about software engineering? How have I progressed in my abilities?

What are the short-term implications of what I've learnt? (When will it be useful?)

What are the long-term implications of what I've learnt? (When will it be useful?)

What would I have done differently if I started the unit over again?

What will I do differently in the future?
